# Project Progress

## 1. Project Overview

Eternal World is a production-oriented AI memory social platform under active backend-first development. The repository currently contains:

- A FastAPI backend
- A Next.js + TypeScript frontend
- PostgreSQL for persistent relational data
- Redis for runtime cache/connectivity checks
- Docker Compose for local orchestration
- GitHub Actions CI for backend and frontend validation

The backend currently includes infrastructure foundations, authentication, Memory Profiles CRUD, a chat backend MVP with a prepared multi-agent architecture tree, a media storage foundation with local server storage abstraction, local media serving plus Memory Profile photo binding for dev/MVP use, a configurable Brain Agent provider foundation with deterministic mock defaults, and a static billing / tariff foundation. The frontend remains minimal and was not expanded as part of the backend slices completed so far.

## 2. Production Architecture Decisions

- Backend framework: FastAPI
- Frontend framework: Next.js with TypeScript
- ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.x ORM
- Database migrations: Alembic
- Primary database: PostgreSQL
- Cache / supporting service: Redis
- Container orchestration: Docker Compose
- Backend auth strategy: JWT bearer tokens
- Password storage: hashed passwords only, never plaintext
- Backend code organization: modular structure with `core`, `db`, and `modules`
- CI strategy: backend `pytest`, frontend `vitest`, frontend production build

## 3. Current Local Ports

- Backend: `8033`
- Frontend: `8017`
- PostgreSQL external: `5543`
- PostgreSQL internal: `db:5432`
- Redis external: `6384`
- Redis internal: `redis:6379`

## 4. Docker Setup Summary

The root `docker-compose.yml` defines four services:

- `db`: `postgres:16-alpine`
- `redis`: `redis:7-alpine`
- `backend`: FastAPI application container built from `backend/Dockerfile`
- `frontend`: Next.js application container built from `frontend/Dockerfile`

Current container names:

- `eternal_world_db`
- `eternal_world_redis`
- `eternal_world_backend`
- `eternal_world_frontend`

Current Docker wiring:

- Backend connects to PostgreSQL through `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://eternal_user:eternal_password@db:5432/eternal_world`
- Backend connects to Redis through `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0`
- Backend Brain Agent defaults to `AI_BRAIN_PROVIDER=mock` in Docker/local dev
- Backend media storage is configured through `MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`, `MEDIA_ROOT=/app/media`, and `MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=/media`
- Frontend is configured to call the backend through `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8033`
- Backend source is mounted into `/app`
- Frontend source is mounted into `/app`

## 5. GitHub Actions / CI Setup Summary

The repository contains `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with two jobs:

- `backend-tests`
  - Python `3.12`
  - installs `backend/requirements.txt`
  - runs `python -m pytest` from `backend`
- `frontend-tests`
  - Node.js `22`
  - runs `npm install`
  - runs `npm test`
  - runs `npm run build`

CI is designed to validate both backend test stability and frontend buildability on every push to `main` and on pull requests.

## 6. Backend Foundation Summary

The backend foundation currently includes:

- FastAPI application entrypoint in `backend/app/main.py`
- CORS middleware configuration from environment settings
- `GET /`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /health/runtime`

Health behavior:

- `/health` returns a simple application status
- `/health/runtime` performs runtime dependency checks against PostgreSQL and Redis
- Runtime health reports `ok` or `degraded`, with service-level status details

Current backend structure is modular:

- `backend/app/core`
- `backend/app/db`
- `backend/app/cache`
- `backend/app/modules/auth`
- `backend/app/modules/billing`
- `backend/app/modules/chat`
- `backend/app/modules/memories`
- `backend/app/modules/media`
- `backend/app/modules/users`
- `backend/app/modules/memory_profiles`
- `backend/app/modules/ai_agents`
- placeholder module packages also exist for future slices

## 7. Database Foundation Summary

The database foundation currently includes:

- SQLAlchemy ORM session and model base
- Alembic migration configuration
- PostgreSQL as the primary relational database

Current ORM models:

- `User`
- `MemoryProfile`
- `ChatMessage`
- `Memory`
- `MediaAsset`

Current migration history:

- `20260616_0001` create core tables
- `20260616_0002` add `users.full_name`
- `20260616_0003` update `memory_profiles` for CRUD support
- `20260616_0004` drop legacy memory-profile columns that were replaced by the CRUD-oriented schema
- `20260617_0005` create `media_assets` table
- `20260617_0006` add `memory_profiles.main_photo_media_id`
- `20260619_0007` add timeline memory fields and `memories.media_id`

Current Alembic head:

- `20260619_0007`

Chat backend note:

- The chat MVP reuses the existing `ChatMessage` model for stored user and assistant messages
- No additional Alembic migration was required for the chat slice

Media storage note:

- The media storage foundation adds a dedicated `MediaAsset` metadata model
- Raw file contents are stored on disk, while PostgreSQL stores metadata and storage identifiers only

- `password` is redacted
- `access_token` is redacted
- `authorization` is redacted
- `secret` is redacted

- uploaded image media can be assigned only when both the profile and the media asset belong to the current user
- only image media (`jpeg`, `png`, `webp`) can be bound as profile photos
- profile photo removal unsets the media reference without touching the stored media metadata
